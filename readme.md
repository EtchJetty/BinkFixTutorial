# Using Bink 2 (Bink2ForUnreal) For Lagless Video Imports in HADES (FULL TUTORIAL)

*(If you already know how to prepare a file to be targeted by Bink, you can [skip ahead to the Bink Settings.](#bink-settings))*


To import a `.bik` formatted video file into Hades without the lag that had previously stopped the community from replacing video files, you can use either the original RAD Video Tools (Bink 1; less options, will have issues with colors, but you can skip the hex editing step) or Bink2ForUnreal (Bink 2, maximum compatibilty and options, requires extra steps outside of RAD Video Tools, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">*recommended*</span>). This guide will be using Bink 2, though we'll cover Bink 1 options when relevant.

<h2>Video creation</h2>
Create whatever video you want, and decide on what animation you want it to replace (new animations entirely are out of scope for this tutorial, though with <a href="https://github.com/SGG-Modding/SGG-Mod-Format/wiki/Import-Type:-SJSON">custom SJSON</a> it is very much possible). In this tutorial, we'll be setting the Club Penguin Penguin's dance to be Zag's idle animation.

By going into `Hades/Content/Movies/`, we can find the `.bik` file that we wantâ€”`ZagreusIdle_Bink.bik`. It has a corresponding `.bik_atlas` file. 

> (The `.bik_atlas` file contains a header and the bink file's name and resolution. If keeping resolution and filename the same (<u>*recommended*</u>), the `.bik_atlas` file can be safely ignored. If changing resolution, skip ahead to [the bik_atlas](#understanding-the-bik-atlas), but understand that this is literally undocumented territory, and may be really annoying to work with.)

Open `RAD Video Tools` or `Bink2ForUnreal.exe` and find your desired video! All screenshots in this tutorial will be using Bink 2, but the process is nearly identical in Bink 1.

You'll want to navigate to your Hades folder (this will likely work for other Supergiant Titles, but this guide was written for Hades) and find its Content subfolder. If your
