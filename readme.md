# Using Bink 2 (Bink2ForUnreal) For Lagless Video Imports in Hades (FULL TUTORIAL)

*(If you already know how to prepare a file to be targeted by Bink, you can [skip ahead to the Bink Settings.](#bink-settings))*

`.bik` files are a kind of highly compressed video file commonly used in game development. Hades, for example, uses pre-rendered `.bik` files to animate its 3D. 

This guide will cover [downloading](#download-info) RAD Video Tools (Bink2ForUnreal), [creating](#video-creation) a video to replace a `.bik` in Hades, properly [adjusting](#bink-settings) Bink 2's settings to stop lag, and [modifying](#hex-editing) the `.bik` to work in Hades, since Hades only "supports" `.bik` videos in version 2.5, which recent updates do not generate. 

To import a `.bik` formatted video file into Hades without the lag that had previously stopped the community from replacing video files, you can use either the original RAD Video Tools (Bink 1; less options, will have issues with colors, but you can skip the hex editing step) or Bink2ForUnreal (Bink 2, maximum compatibilty and options, requires extra steps outside of RAD Video Tools, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">*recommended*</span>). This guide will be using Bink 2, though we'll cover Bink 1 options when relevant.

<h2 id="video-creation">Video Creation</h2>
Create whatever video you want, and decide on what animation you want it to replace (new animations entirely are out of scope for this tutorial, though with <a href="https://github.com/SGG-Modding/SGG-Mod-Format/wiki/Import-Type:-SJSON">custom SJSON</a> it is very much possible). In this tutorial, we'll be setting the Club Penguin Penguin's dance to be Zag's idle animation.

By going into `Hades/Content/Movies/`, we can find the `.bik` file that we wantâ€”`ZagreusIdle_Bink.bik`. It has a corresponding `.bik_atlas` file. 

> (The `.bik_atlas` file contains a header and the bink file's name and resolution. If keeping resolution and filename the same (<u>*recommended*</u>), the `.bik_atlas` file can be safely ignored. If changing resolution, skip ahead to [the bik_atlas](#understanding-the-bik-atlas), but understand that this is literally undocumented territory, and may be really annoying to work with.)

Open `RAD Video Tools` or `Bink2ForUnreal.exe` and find your desired video! All screenshots in this tutorial will be using Bink 2, but the process is nearly identical in Bink 1.

<div align="center"><img style="max-width: 50vw;"  alt="A screenshot of Hades' Content folder." src="docs/b1.png" title="Screenshot of Bink2ForUnreal"></div>

You'll want to navigate to your Hades folder in Bink 2 (this will likely work for other Supergiant Titles, but this guide was written for Hades) and find its Content subfolder. *(If you're having trouble locating that folder, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/26">the description of ModImporter</a> explains how to find it.)*

Once there, go to the Movies subfolder, and click on your chosen .bik. Then click File info. (You can also, for fun, play the file, or, for useful, convert it to an MP4, PNG sequence, or anything else.)

<div align="center"><img style="max-width: 50vw;"  alt="A screenshot of Hades' Movies folder, from within Bink2ForUnreal." src="docs/b2.png" title="Screenshot of Bink2ForUnreal"></div>
<center>(In this example, we scroll down to find <code>ZagreusIdle_Bink.bik</code>.)</center>
<div align="center"><img style="max-width: 50vw;"  alt="A screenshot of Hades' Movies folder, from within Bink2ForUnreal." src="docs/b3.png" title="Screenshot of Bink2ForUnreal"></div>
<p align=center>
(Don't mind the extra copies of <code>ZagreusIdle_Bink.bik</code> - but this is actually a good opportunity to remind you about backing up any game files you modify!) Before taking any further steps, you should rename whatever file you're planning to modify to something like <code>nameoffile_BACKUP.bik</code>in the photo so that it won't be affected later in the process.

Clicking on <u>File Info</u> will make a screen like the below visible:
<br /><br />

<br />
Take note of the width, height, and number of frames. Zagreus's idle animation is 128 pixels wide, 224 pixels tall, and has 3,840 frames of animation. (We will get to the frames of animation.)

Our chosen source gif has 104 unique frames, and is 100 pixels wide and 97 pixels tall, but we're targeting a resolution that does not match that. 

In our example, I'll open the gif in my editor of choice (<a href="https://www.photopea.com/">Photopea.com</a>), though of course you can edit your source file however you want. 
<h3>Video Preparation</h3>

> NOTE! This gif has some frames last longer than others, which means that importing the gif by itself will lead to only the unique frames being included in the `.bik` file!. Using ezgif, I redid the timings and cloned frames in order to have them export in sequence, one-per-frame, but using the gif as linked above will not work! I've attached a [zip file](docs/pengdance-to-crop.zip?raw) to this repo with the uncropped PNG sequence - just import them all into Photopea at once, put all the layers into one folder, and then the guide should be identical.

(It might be helpful to zoom in, especially for smaller images.)

(You should now be able to click and drag to move all of the layers of the project at once! Move them around so that your character is positioned to be standing roughly where Zagreus was.)
